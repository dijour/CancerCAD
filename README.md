# CancerCAD
A Carnegie Mellon University 15-112 Term Project
Author: Dean Dijour
Mentor: Lukas Peraza

Cancer CAD is a medical imaging tool to help doctors and patients understand the three-dimensional characteristics of tumors, using only two-dimensional tumor data (magnetic resonance images).

## DEPENDENCIES
* Python 3 (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* OpenCV (http://docs.opencv.org/3.2.0/d5/de5/tutorial_py_setup_in_windows.html)
* Numpy (pip install numpy)
