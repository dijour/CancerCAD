4/11/2017 - 3 hours - researching various Open CV tools, attempting 
            implementation of thresholding/contrasting methods
4/13/2017 - 2 hours - research point clouds
4/14/2017 - 3 hours - after meeting with Lukas, implementing blob detection
4/17/2017 - 6 hours - fine tuned blob detection (got it to work with keypoints
            on a few of the MRI slices) and began work on the GUI via tkinter
4/18/2017 - 6 hours - finished blob detection, started manual drawing program,
            began making tkinter GUI match storyboard's layout
4/20/2017 - 5 hours - researched 3D plotting modules, found MatPlotLib to be
            suitable for my needs. Fine tuned manual drawing program to export
            2D list of polygons which could be easily read
4/23/2017 - 6 hours - 3D is working! Got MatPlotLib to read a large 2D list of 
            polygon coordinates, and return a height adjusted, triangularized 
            mesh 
4/24/2016 - 7 hours - Finalized 3D functionality in MatPlotLib. 
            Created fully functional GUI, which has self-embedded 
            MatPlotLib graphs (which are dynamic, not static), pop-up error 
            warnings, user prompts, multiple pages, etc.
4/25/2016 - 4 hours - Integrated most of the different functionalities into 
            the "Main.py" file
4/28/2016 - 6 hours - 3D PRINTING WORKS! Can now convert any polygon mesh into
            and STL (3D printable file). Had to figure out how to integrate 
            existing STL converter frameworks to work with my mesh's 
            simple data structure
5/1/2016  - 5 hours - created GitHub for the project, began work on creating 
            an executable version of the program. Finished video, uploaded
            to YouTube, and updated the GitHub. Done!
5/2/2016  - 6 hours - Turns out I wasn't done...
            Simplified GUI interface in response to peer feedback, 
            deleted 2 pages by adding 3D printing functionality (save as STL) 
            into earlier pages. Re-recorded video with new functionality,
            uploaded to YouTube.
